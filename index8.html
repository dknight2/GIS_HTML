          Welcome to where I live in Buckhead, Atlanta! I took the time to collect all of this data 
		  myself and create a map with it! The apartment I live in is the bottom 
		  right building surface with all of the trash can symbols surrounding it! 
		  Please feel free to peruse the area; all point features have a picture attached 
		  to it so you can see what kind of food, shopping, or business is there.
