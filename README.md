# GIS_HTML
This is the repo for GIS Web Applications. Most of them use the ESRI Javascript API. 
The documents are all named accordingly, so to run index1, you will also need main1.css and main1.js etc. some of the maps are missing data due to file
size restrictions, and I can make those available upon request via email. Most of these maps are pretty simple and display simple functionality. Index3 will have empty data because this project was done using hosting the data locally via geoserver; it is a geological map of the state of Georgia!

There are some maps that weren't uploaded due to file size; these include maps using tiled imagery and pulling data from other proprietary sources.
